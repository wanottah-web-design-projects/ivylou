<P><center><font face="Georgia" size="+5" color="#A6C0C5">Hello!</font></center><br><br><font face="Georgia">Nice to see you here. <br><br>I live in Suffolk, with my wonderful husband, also know as 'Boy.' We have no children, or pets, but we do have lots of strawberry plants! <br><br>Aside from writing about the things I potter about doing, I am an Art Technician (read: tidy-upperer) at a local Upper School and I am currently studying with the Open University, working towards a Humanities with Literature degree. I work part time, study part time, sleep alot of the time, and at most times have a cup of tea in my hands!<br><br>This site is about the goings on of my house and head. It may not always make sense, but I hope that it always looks pretty! <br><br>In thinking about the why and how of ivylou.com I owe many thanks to many people... My Mum, for teaching me to make a sandwich cake when I was 11; My Dad for inspiring me to pick up a camera and do something artistic with it; My Dear Friend, Sarah, for being my taste-tester (sometimes unknowingly!); The Second Best Person In The Whole World, Naomi, for always thinking the best of me, and to My Amazing Boy for allowing me to spend so much time, and money, doing nothing in particular, whilst drinking copious amounts of tea! <br><br>As well as these specific people there is a whole host of people who have continually encouraged me, asked for cake, and wanted to know how I did 'such and such' - I hope this site is useful to you guys in particular. <br><br>This blog is the culmination of years of experimentation in the kitchen and the studio, and here's to many more to come! Have a wander around, and enjoy!<br><br><br> <i>ivylou</i></font></P>
